# Cursor AI Rules for AIFPL Project

## Git Workflow
- **ALWAYS commit and push changes immediately** - This is a hobby project, no production concerns
- **Never leave uncommitted changes** - If you modify a file, commit and push it
- **Keep local and remote in sync** - After any file modification, verify with `git status` and commit/push

## Code Changes
- When modifying any file, immediately:
  1. Check `git status` to see what changed
  2. `git add <files>`
  3. `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
  4. `git push origin main`

## File Modifications
- If you read a file and see it has content that differs from git, check:
  1. `git diff HEAD <file>` to see uncommitted changes
  2. `git show HEAD:<file>` to see committed version
  3. If local has changes, commit them immediately

## Database/Backend Changes
- When adding new API endpoints, ensure:
  1. Backend route is in `backend/api/main.py`
  2. Database methods are in `backend/database/crud.py`
  3. Models are in `backend/database/models.py`
  4. ALL changes are committed and pushed

## Frontend Changes
- When modifying frontend:
  1. Test locally if possible
  2. Commit and push immediately
  3. GitHub Actions will auto-deploy frontend

## Backend Deployment
- After pushing backend changes:
  1. Render will auto-deploy (if configured)
  2. Or manually trigger deploy on Render dashboard
  3. Always verify deployment completed successfully
